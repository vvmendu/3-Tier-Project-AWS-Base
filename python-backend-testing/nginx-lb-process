1. Default (Round Robin)

Requests are distributed evenly, one by one.

upstream backend_servers {
    server 172.31.18.89:5000;
    server 172.31.18.90:5000;
    server 172.31.18.91:5000;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend_servers;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;

        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}


✅ Best for: equal servers, simple setups

2. Least Connections

Sends traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.

upstream backend_servers {
    least_conn;
    server 172.31.18.89:5000;
    server 172.31.18.90:5000;
    server 172.31.18.91:5000;
}


✅ Best for: long-running requests, uneven load

3. IP Hash (Session Persistence)

Same client IP → same backend (sticky sessions).

upstream backend_servers {
    ip_hash;
    server 172.31.18.89:5000;
    server 172.31.18.90:5000;
}


✅ Best for: apps with in-memory sessions
❌ Not ideal behind NAT / mobile users

4. Hash (Advanced / Sticky by Key)

Distribute based on a specific value (cookie, header, etc.).

upstream backend_servers {
    hash $request_uri consistent;
    server 172.31.18.89:5000;
    server 172.31.18.90:5000;
}


Other useful hash keys:

hash $remote_addr;
hash $http_user_agent;
hash $cookie_sessionid;


✅ Best for: predictable routing, cache-friendly apps

5. Weighted Load Balancing

Send more traffic to stronger servers.

upstream backend_servers {
    server 172.31.18.89:5000 weight=3;
    server 172.31.18.90:5000 weight=1;
}


Meaning:

.89 gets 75% traffic

.90 gets 25% traffic

6. Failover & Health Control

Mark servers as backup or limit failures.

upstream backend_servers {
    server 172.31.18.89:5000 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s;
    server 172.31.18.90:5000 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s;
    server 172.31.18.91:5000 backup;
}


backup → used only if others fail

max_fails → retries before marking down

After Changes

Always test and reload:

sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx

Which one should you use?

Stateless API → least_conn

Login/session app → ip_hash or hash cookie

Different server sizes → weight

Simple setup → default round-robin
